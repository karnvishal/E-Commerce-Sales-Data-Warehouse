### dbt Configuration Highlights

```yaml
# Materialization strategies
models:
  dimensions: table  # Materialized for performance
  facts: incremental  # 3-day lookback window
  marts: table  # Business user access

# Performance optimizations
- Date partitioning on order_date fields
- Unique key constraints for data integrity
- Schema separation by business function
```
